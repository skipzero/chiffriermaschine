# Enigma Machine

This is a attempt to create a WWII enigma machine asused but the germans and possibly other axis powers(?).
While it does allow the switching of rotors and positions of the rotors, I'm still working on surfacing the reflector and the plugboard which were features of the original.

## Built using react and javascript.
